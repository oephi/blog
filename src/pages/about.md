## Hi there

I am Ryan and this is the workings of my mind and the experiences of my explorations beyond.

I am a Software Developer by trade and have spent over the last 20 years using various methods and techniques to gain insight into our place in the cosmos.  I have always been drawn towards both technology and spiritual experience and have never seen these two things as being at odds to one another.  They are infact complementary and both vital in the next phase we are moving into.

Hopefully the words contained within this humble website will help you.  And if not, I hope atleast they will not hinder.

Nama Gana.    

This is for you
